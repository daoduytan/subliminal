                    <p>
                        When people talk about subliminal messages, they're talking about "commands" which are sent straight to
                        the subconscious mind - for example, affirmations such as "I feel great" or
                        "I am confident." Subliminal means "below the threshold of consciousness."
                        Subliminal messages therefore refer to messages which are displayed
                        "below the threshold of consciousness." Subliminal Power can flash
                        messages as quickly as 1 millisecond! This isn't enough for the critical
                        conscious mind to comprehend. But the unquestioning, non-critical
                        subconscious mind picks up on these statements directly - and accepts
                        them as fact.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mtb-0 ">
                        By flashing just one message every second, that means Subliminal Power delivers an astounding 28,800 affirmations direct to your subconscious in a typical 8-hour shift. No wonder it's so powerful!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Subliminal Power was originally designed by self-development leader Bradley
                        Thompson, way back in 1999. We've been selling it to the public for over 9 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It flashes subtle affirmation messages on your screen, while you use your
                        computer. These messages are set to display for between 1 and 750 milliseconds
                        (you control how quickly), so aren't typically seen by the conscious mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The subconscious mind however recognizes these affirmations, and takes them
                        on board as fact - using them to help "reprogram" your inner mind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="cf">Subliminal Power has received rave reviews since its initial launch over a decade ago, including praise from Olympian athletes such as Ruben Gonzalez, and industry leaders such as David Riklan.</p>

                    <p class="mtb-0">Today, 2012 sees the launch of the latest version - Subliminal Power 2 - alongside a whole host of new features and benefits.</p>

                    <h2>How does Subliminal Power work?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Subliminal Power works by briefly flashing positive affirmations on your computer<br class="hidden-xs"> screen, as you work.</p>

                    <p>The messages only appear for 100 milliseconds, meaning they're too<br class="hidden-xs"> quick to be picked up by the critical conscious mind. The subconscious mind however absorbs<br class="hidden-xs"> everything - and accepts the commands as fact,<br class="hidden-xs"> using them to change your underlying brain rules and thought patterns.</p>

                    <p class="mtb-0">Subliminal Power delivers an average of 28,800 positive affirmations direct to your<br class="hidden-xs"> subconscious mind every working day, resulting in change that is both quick and long-lasting.</p>

                    <p>However, after over a decade, Bradley Thompson's team decided that it was time to give the entire

                    <p>The new Subliminal Power 2 includes everything that the original Subliminal Power application has, with a
                    whole lot more thrown in. Users have already called it "ten times better" than the original version. </p>
